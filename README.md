# Description
A predictive model that can forecast the likelihood of specific crimes occurring in designated locations, providing residents with proactive insights to enhance their safety

# Methodology
The project methodology employs machine learning techniques to analyze patterns within the compiled crime and weather datasets, training a model to identify and classify potential crimes. This process involves cleaning the data, selecting features, and applying algorithms to predict the likelihood of different types of crimes occurring

# Data Collection
The project's data was gathered from two main sources using APIs. Crime data was obtained from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), detailing incidents dating back to 2020. This dataset provides a comprehensive look at various crimes within the city. Weather data was sourced from Visual Crossing, offering insights into the potential impact of weather on crime occurrences. Together, these datasets form a rich basis for analyzing crime patterns in relation to weather conditions, aiming to predict crime types more effectively
